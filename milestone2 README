# ASBG

ASBG is an online 2 player board game modelled using ideas from the game of chess and memoir44. The goal of the game is to capture
the opponent's general by slowly advancing game pieces in strategic locations. For milestone 2, our goal was to create a working
prototype where users are able to complete the game. For this milestone, the gameplay has not been finalised as we needed more
time to ensure a proper balance between all the pieces in the game as well as make sure one game does not take up too much time. 
However, we ensured that the pieces are able to move and attack appropriately based on their assigned stats as well as ensuring the
game comes to an end when either player defeats the boss piece of the other.

# Features
1. Main menu
   - Main menu for players to start game and exit. Turn-based where both players will be using the same console (to be upgraded to 
   online multiplayer if time and complexity permits). Once game is started, each player will get to choose between 3 generals
   (shining knight, dragon knight and armored titan).

   Once the selection is done, the players will be brought to the game board with red and blue pieces on either side.
   
2. Game board
   - The game board is a 9x9 board with red pieces on one side and blue pieces on the other side, just like the game of chess. 
   - The game board is designed such that each player will have 2 rows of his own pieces, with the front row filled with infantry 
     and and the back row containing scout, mage, archer, cavalry, general, cavalry, archer, mage and scout in that order.

3. Pieces 
   - Each game piece is assigned 4 attributes, which are health, attack power, attack range and movement range. Each piece is
     assigned different levels of each attribute.
   * Scouts
      * Fast and deadly unit. Hp 4 Movement speed 3 Attack 3 Attack range 1
   * Archers
      * Long-ranged unit. Hp 5 Movement speed 1 Attack 2 Attack range 3
   * Mage
      * Support unit. Hp 6 Movement speed 1 Attack 2 Attack range 2
      * Can 'attack' own unit, which increases the Hp of the target by 2 points
   * Cavalry
      * Balanced unit. Hp 8 Movement speed 2 Attack 2 Attack range 1
   * Infantry
      * normal unit. Hp 7 Movement speed 1 Attack 2 Attack range 1
   * Generals
       * boss unit 
       * Shining Knight Hp 10 Movement speed 1 Attack 3 Attack range 2
       * Dragon Knight Hp 8 Movement speed 2 Attack 4 Attack range 1
       * Armored Titan Hp 12 Movement speed 1 Attack 3 Attack range 1

4. Every turn
   - Every turn, the player can select any piece using the cursor to either move or attack, based on the piece's attack range or 
     movement range.
   - Possible cells that a piece can either move to or launch an attack on will be outlined (red for attack and black for movement).
     When the player selects one of the outlined cells, his choice would be executed and his turn would be completed. 
   - This would alternate between both players.

5. Attack
   - An attack will occur when a player selects his piece to a cell that is outlined in red and contains the opponent piece. 
   - There are 2 outcomes of an attack, a success of a fail. The attacker would not receive any reduction in hp no matter the 
     outcome. 
   - The outcome is determined by a dice roll between 1 to 6. This dice roll would be done for both the attacker and defender using 
     RNG. The dice roll of the defender and attacker would be added to their respective attack power. If the sum for the attacker is
     lower than or equal to that of the defender, the result is a fail and nothing happens. If the sum for the attacker is higher than 
     that of the defender, the difference would be taken and this difference would be deducted from the defender's hp. 
   - When the hp of a piece is deducted to 0, it will be removed from the board.
 
6. Special cells 
   - The board has designated special cells (hill and barracks) that give the pieces certain increase to specific attributes. 
   - Hill gives +2 attack
   - Barracks give +2 hp
   
7. Endgame
   - The game ends when either player's general is killed (i.e hp reduced to 0) and the board would be reset.

# Problems Faced

1. Coming up with a proper way for pieces to attack each other
   - Tentatively, we used RNG between 1 to 6 to decide the outcome of an attack. More testing needs to be done since the RNG range
     might be too large.
     
2. Deciding between attack and movement for individual pieces     
   - Initially, we wanted to implement an "attack" button and an "advance" button that would appear side by side when the player 
     selects a unit. The "attack" button would show the cells the piece can launch an attack on while the "advance" button would
     show the cells the piece can move to. However, this could make it confusing for the player to decide if he wants to attack or
     move since the "attack" and "advance" cells are not shown together. 
   - Hence, we decided to remove the buttons and superimpose the possible "attack" and "advance" cells with red and black outlines 
     respectively when the player selects a unit.
 
3. Including main menu feature
   - The goal for this milestone was to esnure the game can be properly executed without hiccups. Any addtional features were not
     touched on much so the main menu was not included this time since we are still working on it. Hence, for this milestone, the 
     generals are preset and players cannot choose the geenral they want to use.
     


# Things to improve on for milestone 3

1. Making visuals more appealing.
2. Have animation for movement of troops to make game more interesting.
3. Include attack or defence texts to show how a battle between 2 pieces went. Possibly add animation to show a successful kill or
   defence.
4. Improving gameplay and finalising the hp, attack and attack range of the troops.
5. Showing the attack power, attack range and movement range of each unit so that places do not have to remember the attribute of 
   each piece.
6. Main menu for players to choose their general.   
6. Introducing game over screen for players to reset thier choice of general and replay the game.
