# ASBG

ASBG is an online 2 player board game modelled using ideas from the game of chess and memoir44. The goal of the game is to capture
the opponent's general by slowly advancing game pieces in strategic locations. For milestone 2, our goal was to create a working
prototype where users are able to complete the game. For this milestone, the gameplay has not been finalised as we needed more
time to ensure a proper balance between all the pieces in the game as well as make sure one game does not take up too much time. 
However, we ensured that the pieces are able to move and attack appropriately based on their assigned stats as well as ensuring the
game comes to an end when either player defeats the boss piece of the other.

# Level of Achievement

Gemini

# Features
1. Main menu for players to start game and exit. Turn-based where both players will be using the same console (to be upgraded to 
   online multiplayer if time and complexity permits). Once game is started, each player will get to choose between 3 generals
   (shining knight, dragon knight and armored titan). 
   

# Problems Faced

1. Coming up with a proper way for pieces to attack each other
   - Tentatively, we used RNG between 1 to 6 to decide the outcome of an attack. More testing needs to be done since the RNG range
     might be too large.
     
2. Deciding between attack and movement for individual pieces     
   - Initially, we wanted to implement an "attack" button and an "advance" button that would appear side by side when the player 
     selects a unit. The "attack" button would show the cells the piece can launch an attack on while the "advance" button would
     show the cells the piece can move to. However, this could make it confusing for the player to decide if he wants to attack or
     move since the "attack" and "advance" cells are not shown together. 
   - Hence, we decided to remove the buttons and superimpose the possible "attack" and "advance" cells with red and black outlines 
     respectively when the player selects a unit.
 
3. Including main menu feature
   - The goal for this milestone was to esnure the game can be properly executed without hiccups. Any addtional features were not
     touched on much so the main menu was not included this time since we are still working on it. Hence, for this milestone, the 
     generals are preset and players cannot choose the geenral they want to use.
     


# Things to improve on for milestone 3

1. Making visuals more appealing
2. Have animation for movement of troops to make game more interesting
3. Include attack or defence texts to show how a battle between 2 pieces went. Possibly add animation to show a successful kill or
   defence
4. Improving gameplay and finalising the hp, attack and attack range of the troops
